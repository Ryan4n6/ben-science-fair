## VARIABLES

### Independent Variable (What I Changed)
How much weight I added to the car. I used tungsten weights and tested four amounts:
- **0 grams** added (just the car by itself)
- **+3.5 grams** of tungsten taped on
- **+7 grams** of tungsten taped on
- **+14 grams** of tungsten taped on

### Dependent Variable (What I Measured)
**Speed** in meters per second (m/s) and **time** in seconds (s).

My speed trap has sensors at the start and finish of the track. It times how long the car takes to go from one end to the other. Then it figures out speed by doing: speed = distance ÷ time.

It also calculates two other things:
- **Momentum** (mass × speed) — this tells you how hard something would hit
- **Kinetic energy** (½ × mass × speed²) — this tells you how much energy the car has while it's moving

### Controlled Variables (What I Kept the Same)
- **Track:** Same Hot Wheels track every time, 5.85 meters long, same ramp angle
- **Start position:** I put the car in the exact same spot at the top every time
- **How I let go:** I let go with my hand from the same spot (I never pushed it)
- **Type of car:** Ford F-150 Hot Wheels truck for all runs
- **NFC sticker:** Each car has a little sticker so the system knows which car it is (only weighs 0.025 grams)
- **Number of tries:** I ran each car 3 times for every weight amount
- **Measurement tool:** I used the same M.A.S.S. Trap sensor system for every single run

## MATERIALS LIST

1. M.A.S.S. Trap speed trap system (my dad and I built it using an ESP32 computer and infrared sensors)
2. Hot Wheels track — 5.85 meters long (that's 19.2 feet)
3. 2 Hot Wheels Ford F-150 trucks (same model, from the same package)
4. Tungsten weights — 3.5 gram, 7 gram, and 14 gram pieces
5. Digital scale that measures to 0.001 grams
6. 2 NFC stickers to identify each car (0.025 grams each)
7. Laptop to see the M.A.S.S. Trap dashboard

## PROCEDURE (Step by Step)

1. Weigh each car on the scale. Write down the weight.
2. Stick an NFC tag on each car. Weigh again and write down the new weight.
3. Set up the track with sensors at the start and finish.
4. Turn on the M.A.S.S. Trap and open the dashboard on my laptop.
5. **No added weight:** Put the car at the top of the ramp. Let go. The sensors time it automatically. Do this 3 times for each car, switching back and forth (Control, Test, Control, Test...).
6. **+3.5g:** Tape 3.5 grams of tungsten to each car. Run 3 trials per car.
7. **+7g:** Tape 7 grams of tungsten to each car. Run 3 trials per car.
8. **+14g:** Tape 14 grams of tungsten to each car. Run 3 trials per car.
9. If any run looks wrong (like the car hit the wall), run an extra trial to replace it.
10. The system saves everything automatically. Look at the data and figure out the averages.
