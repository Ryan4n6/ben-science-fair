# Does Adding Weight to a Hot Wheels Car Make It Go Faster?

**Ben Massfeller | Grade 5 | 2026 Science Fair**

## About This Project

I built a speed trap called the **M.A.S.S. Trap** (Motion Analysis & Speed System) with my dad. It uses infrared sensors and an ESP32 computer to time Hot Wheels cars on a 5.85-meter track.

I tested whether adding weight to a car makes it faster or slower by running two Ford F-150 trucks with 0g, 3.5g, 7g, and 14g of tungsten weights.

## What I Found

- A little extra weight (3.5g) made both cars faster
- Too much weight (14g) made the heavier car slower
- The lighter car kept getting faster at every weight
- There's a "sweet spot" for the best speed
